Visgence Technology Lissajous Mote Software


About

This repository contains the software for the Lissajous Mote by Visgence 
Technology.


Features

The current version of the firmware contains the demo shown at the 2011
Open Hardware Summit. In addition to board firmware (Arduino project), the 
repository also contains the web demo software, which is based on 
Mojolicious (http://code.google.com/p/flot/) and Flot (http://mojolicio.us/)


Requirements

The Xbee socket on the Lissajous Mote is not connected to the UART of the 
ATMega, so you will require a "soft serial" library in order to communicate
with it. The firmware on this site uses the NewSoftSerial library by 
Mikal Hart:

The web demo will run on any computer using Mojolicios' built-in webserver.
But you will need a current installation of Perl, Mojolicious, IPC::Sharelite
(libipc-sharelite-perl) and Device::SerialPort (available from the apt package libdevice-serialport-perl)


Installation

The code can be checked out into your Arduino sketchbook directory.
